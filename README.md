With the rise in popularity of drill music, a genre akin to mainstream hip-hop rap, but grittier in sound, there have been growing concerns about the negative influence of drill music on the behaviors of young adults who are its primary consumers. Drill music is known for its explicit, violent lyrics and intense instrumental. That is the nature of the genre. Concerns surrounding this genre of music is reflected in the efforts made by the authorities, especially in the U.K to censor drill artists by taking down their music videos on youtube. Also, a testament to the concerns surrounding the genre is that some parents ban their kids from listening to drill music. So, does drill music have a negative effect on the youth? Does it make them more physically aggressive?
