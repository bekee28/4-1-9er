A  self-reported, well-established questionnaire containing a scale to assess physical aggression was used for data collection. This questionnaire is based on the 29-Item Aggression Questionnaire (Buss & Perry, 1992). Out of the 29 items in the questionnaire, 9 of them pertain to physical aggression, and those were the ones used in this survey.

In addition to the questionnaire, these additional questions were added:

 'What is an estimate for the number of fights you've been involved in over the last six months',
 
 'For how many years or months have you been listening to Drill music',
 
 'On average, how many hours a week do you spend listening to Drill music'
 
The 166 respondents are categorized into three groups: Light, Medium, and Heavy listeners based on the amount of time spent listening to drill music per week. 

77 respondents listen to drill music for up to 7 hours per week (no more than an hour a day on average) which is classified as light levels of listening. 

57 respondents listen for more than 7 hours, but no more than 21 hours per week (no less than an hour per day, but no more than 3 hours a day on average) which classifies them under the medium levels of listening.

32 respondents who listen for more than 21 hours per week (averaging more than 3 hours a day) are classified under the heavy listener category.
